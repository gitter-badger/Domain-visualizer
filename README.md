# Domain-visualizer
Chrome extension for visualizing domains.

Domain visualizer monitors the current domain for you and tries to match it to one of the stored domains.
If the domain matches a stored one, html is prepended into the body of the DOM.

This extension is very handy for web developers who often get confused if the website displaying in front of them is a local one or the test/production website

The html prepended into the dom can be configured in the add domain modal, there you can either configure the pre selected configuration options or you can insert your own custom html.

features:
- Domain monitoring
- Custom html
- Import/Export
- Domain root discovery
- Popup with listed domains for quick access to the monitored domains.

Install from the
[Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domain-visualizer/ocpeldmmenlcanjkjbmgdbckgilimkme)
